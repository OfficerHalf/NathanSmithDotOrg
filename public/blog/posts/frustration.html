    <h1>Frustration</h1>

    <p>Things are piling on: The girlfriend's cat died, Jeffrey has cancer, wedding planning stress, politics, disasters. It adds a sensitivity, like a hair trigger on my brain that starts flashing red with the lightest touch.</p>

    <p>So even though the real problem isn't work - the emotion happens at work. The anger is triggered at work. And I know it's happening; I'm watching it. But that doesn't change the feeling - the soul part of the equation. It's the oncoming storm that I see coming but feel powerless to stop.</p>

    <p>Really, this anger and frustration is a symptom of being human, and a result of poor experience with negative meta-emotion. We all have feelings, passions, and emotions - those are what make us human - but they should not control us.</p>

        <p>But the fruit of the Spirit is [...] patience, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. <br> -Galatians 5:22</p>
